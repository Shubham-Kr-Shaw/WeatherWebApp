# WeatherWebApp
- Techs Used - Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy.
- It is a very simple web application where I have consumed an api form openweathermap.org and displayed its returned data which was in json format to the used by integrating it with the frontend.
- And also stored the search history of the user using SQLAlchemy.
